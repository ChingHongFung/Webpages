# Webpages

## Aim of this repository

I am new to web development and have recently started learning HTML and CSS. I hope to practise my skills by regularly making websites as I study. Here are a few of my early projects. Some of them are tasks associated with the CodeAcademy skill path: Building a Website with HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites)

I will continue to post more webpages as I learn more advanced tools including JavaScript and its frameworks (React.js).
