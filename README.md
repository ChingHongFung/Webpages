# Webpages

I am new to web development and have recently started learning HTML and CSS. I hope to practise my skills by regularly making websites as I study. Here are a few of my early projects. Some of them are tasks associated with the CodeAcademy skill path: Building a Website with HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites)

#### excursion_travel project(Updated on 12/10/2021):
I built a very simple website for a model travel company. Specification is included.
